## Project Goals

> In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. However, implementing the methods from lodash on your own is an invaluable exercise in problem-solving and a great way to understand how the methods work! Weâ€™ve selected ten methods for you to implement and, in implementing each method, you will follow these four steps: (1) Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing, (2) Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code, (3) Implement our game plan, and, (4) Test our code to ensure it works as expected.
